*PhD candidate ¬∑ University of Warsaw ¬∑ Artificial Intelligence ¬∑ Mathematics*

Former math student, now exploring the boundaries between mathematics, artificial intelligence, and language. My work focuses on language models and their ability to reason, reflect, and sometimes hallucinate.

> I am fascinated by the intersection of psychology and AI. In particular, I apply psychological frameworks and experimental paradigms to study, challenge, and sometimes surprise artificial models.

My research is rarely done alone ‚Äì I share my home office with five cats ("the demons"), who are convinced every keyboard was made for them.
